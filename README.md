# FinalProjectBuildingAI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A quiz based revision system for students especially targetting students appearing for class Xth CBSE exam in India. The tool will ask questions in a fun manner so that revision doesn't 
become a chore. Quirky questions and funny answers can go a long way to make the students retain the answer. The student can ask for a hint and we will design the hint to make him associate 
the concept with the question being asked.


## Background

Revising books before exams is boring and children find it difficult to concentrate. It is especially true for children who are not interested in the subject. There are children
who are not at all interested in Science but CBSE class Xth exam make these students take the Science paper too. The students go for rote method and really struggle. The AI Tool can 
help them easily revise the concepts. Moreover, if some of them can be made to overcome their fear of the subject, that would be a huge plus. 
The idea will always be to tap into the study materials publicly available and then use AI to make a question on the fly about a concept. Suppose the student wants to revise Reflection 
in the Physics subject. About 10-12 questions could be easily conjured to help the child revise the concepts. the AI tool can tap into the last 10 years of Science papers of CBSE to 
zero upon the concepts that the child needs to be aware of.


## How is it used?

The children preparing for Class Xth CBSE exam are the target audience. The AI tool will help revise the key concepts with funky questions so that the child could enjoy learning and revising the concepts. 
We can have 2 types of questions :
Quick Hit: “What gas do plants crave?” (Ans: Carbon dioxide)
Thinker: “Why does iron blush red?” (Ans: Rust, oxidation)

There will be a reward system for the child but there won't be any score card. The questions can be attempted anytime after completing the chapter. The child can complete a chapter and then  immediately go for a quick revision for that will help him in revision or he could wait for a week and take the quiz to reinforce the concepts. There will be no stress on the child. In case the child takes more than 30 seconds, the tool will offer a clue. The clue will also be fun based like "It’s a chemical kiss with oxygen" for the question about rust.

## Data sources and AI methods
NCERT Textbooks: Free PDFs at ncert.nic.in—covers all 13 chapters (e.g., Acids, Bases, Salts, Heredity). Core concepts, diagrams, and exercises.
CBSE Sample Papers: cbseacademic.nic.in has 2024-25 papers—shows question styles (MCQs, short answers).

## Challenges

The tool can't take the place of the books. It is not meant to teach the concepts. Rather, it is a helping hand to make the revision task a bit more enjoyable.

## What next?

The class XIIth CBSE exam are very difficult for children who take science stream. A question bank to help them revise the concepts would be great but mostly all these resources are not publicly available. One will have to spend time to create a question bank ready for the AI tool.

Grok was very helpful in fleshing out the idea.
